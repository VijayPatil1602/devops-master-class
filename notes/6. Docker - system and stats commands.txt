We going to look into system and stats commands 


In cmd or terminal : 

	* docker system (if you type this cmd , you will get an error )
	
	        df - show docker disk usage
		events - Get real time events from the server
		info - Display system-wide information
		prune - remove unused data

	* docker system df
	* docker system events ( show us the run time events )

	* docker system prune -a(all unused) ( remove unused data )


****** stats commands

	* docker stats ( will to show how much memory storage are
			being used and all by container)	
    (OR)* docker stats (id of the container )
	
	* docker container stop (id of container)

***** We can also configure how much CPU, and how much memory that particular
	container can use by using (-m)=memory in run command:

	* docker container run -d -p 5000:5000 -m(memory) 512m(mega bytes)
		in28min/hello-world-java:0.0.1.RELEASE

***** How much CPU you want to assign
	--cpu-quota=100%=100000, 50% = 50000

	* docker container run -d -p 5000:5000 -m(memory) 512m(mega bytes)
		 --cpu-quota=50000  in28min/hello-world-java:0.0.1.RELEASE
