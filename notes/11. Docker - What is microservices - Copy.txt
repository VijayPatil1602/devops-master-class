What is Microservices >  
	* Small automonous services that work together.
	* In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to 
	  developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running
	  in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an
	  HTTP resource API.
	* These services are built arount business capabilities and independently
 	  deployable by fully automated deployment machinery..
	* There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which
	  may be written in different programming languages and use different data
	  storage technologies..


MICROSERVICES :> microservices are basically services which are exposed by REST.
		 In addition to that, you have small deployable units with very well
		 thought-out boundaries. Small well chosen deployable units and these
		 should be cloud enabled.


Advantages of Microservices :>

	* The most important advantage of the microservice architecture is that it 
	  enables you to adapt new technology and processes very easily.
	* When we build applications as a combination of microservices, which can 
	  communicate with each other using simple messages, each of these microservices
	  can be built in different technologies.
	* microservices is dynamic scaling.
